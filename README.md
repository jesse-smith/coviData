# coviData </a><img src='hex-covidata(1).png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

coviData is designed to help with ETL, munging, and basic analysis of COVID-19
data within the Shelby County Health Department. It aims to provide a complete
framework for down/loading, cleaning, and summarizing this data. The goal is to
make human input easy when creativity is needed and difficult when consistency
is the priority.
