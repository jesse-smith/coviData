Description: coviData is designed to help with ETL,
    munging, and basic analysis of COVID-19 data within the Shelby County
    Health Department. It aims to provide a complete framework for
    down/loading, cleaning, and summarizing this data. The goal is to make
    human input easy when creativity is needed and difficult when
    consistency is the priority.
