\usage{
read_file_delim(
  file,
  col_select = NULL,
  col_types = vroom::cols(.default = vroom::col_character()),
  na = c("", ".", "NA", "na", "Na", "N/A", "n/a", "N/a", "NULL", "null", "Null"),
  guess_max = .Machine$integer.max\%/\%100L,
  delim = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{path to a local file.}

\item{col_select}{One or more selection expressions, like in
\code{dplyr::select()}. Use \code{c()} or \code{list()} to use more than one expression.
See \code{?dplyr::select} for details on available selection options.}

\item{col_types}{One of \code{NULL}, a \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols()}} specification, or
a string. See \code{vignette("readr")} for more details.

If \code{NULL}, all column types will be imputed from the first 1000 rows
on the input. This is convenient (and fast), but not robust. If the
imputation fails, you'll need to increase the \code{guess_max} or supply the
correct types yourself.

Column specifications created by \code{\link[=list]{list()}} or \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols()}} must contain
one column specification for each column. If you only want to read a
subset of the columns, use \code{\link[readr:cols]{cols_only()}}.

Alternatively, you can use a compact string representation where each
character represents one column:
\itemize{
\item c = character
\item i = integer
\item n = number
\item d = double
\item l = logical
\item f = factor
\item D = date
\item T = date time
\item t = time
\item ? = guess
\item _ or - = skip

By default, reading a file without a column specification will print a
message showing what \code{readr} guessed they were. To remove this message,
set \code{show_col_types = FALSE} or set `options(readr.show_col_types = FALSE).
}}

\item{na}{Character vector of strings to interpret as missing values. Set this
option to \code{character()} to indicate no missing values.}

\item{guess_max}{Maximum number of lines to use for guessing column types.}

\item{delim}{One or more characters used to delimit fields within a
file. If \code{NULL} the delimiter is guessed from the set of \code{c(",", "\t", " ", "|", ":", ";")}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{\link[vroom:vroom]{vroom()}}}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} if reading one file; a list of \code{tibble}s if reading
multiple
}
\description{
\code{read_file_delim()} reads delimited files using
\code{\link[vroom:vroom]{vroom()}}. This allows the use of ALTREP columns,
which don't load data into memory until they are needed.
}
\details{
By default, \code{read_file_delim()} does not attempt to guess column types and
reads all columns as character. This can be changed by setting
\code{col_types = vroom::cols(.default = vroom::col_guess())}. If columns are
guessed, the default is to use all rows; this can be changed by setting
\code{guess_max} to a different value.

This saves a
significant amount of time and space when loading data with many rarely used
columns.\code{read_file_delim()} will eventually be paired with
\code{read_file_excel()} to replace the internals of
\code{\link[coviData:read_file]{read_file()}}.
